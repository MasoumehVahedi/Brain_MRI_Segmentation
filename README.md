# Brain Tumor Semantic Segmentation
The first usage of the attention module was to improve the encoder decoder-based neural system for translation in natural language processing (NLP). After that, this type of model was used in computer vision and other applications.
The goal of the attention model is to create CNN learn and focus more on the important information, rather than learning non-useful background information.

## Content
The dataset includes brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks. In this case, the dataset was used for semantic segmentation to Brain Tumor in images.
